# GitHub Setup Commands for Tone Picker Project

## Step 1: Initialize Git Repository (if not already done)
git init

## Step 2: Add all files to staging
git add .

## Step 3: Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Tone Picker application with React, Express, and Mistral AI integration"

## Step 4: Create a new repository on GitHub
# Go to https://github.com/new
# Repository name: tone-picker
# Description: AI-powered text tone adjustment tool with 2x2 matrix interface
# Make it public (for the take-home test)
# Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

## Step 5: Add GitHub remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/tone-picker.git

## Step 6: Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

## Alternative: If you prefer SSH (after setting up SSH keys)
# git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/tone-picker.git
# git push -u origin main

## Step 7: Verify upload
# Visit https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/tone-picker
# Check that all files are uploaded including:
# - README.md
# - All source code
# - package.json
# - .env file should NOT be uploaded (it's in .gitignore)

## Additional Commands (if needed):

# To check current status
git status

# To check remote URL
git remote -v

# To add more commits later
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push

# To create a new branch for features
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
git push -u origin feature/new-feature

## Notes:
# - Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username
# - The .env file with your API key will NOT be pushed (it's in .gitignore for security)
# - Make sure to update the clone URL in README.md after creating the repository
